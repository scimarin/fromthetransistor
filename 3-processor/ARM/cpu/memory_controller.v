/*
* ARM memory controller.
*
* Given an address in memory, the controller either:
* - fetches the data at that address either sequentially or non-sequentially and then puts that data on
*   the bus making it available to the processor
* - takes the data given by the processor from the bus and puts it into memory at the specified address
*
* There are two types of memory accesses, controlled by nmreq and seq:
* - nmreq 0  seq 0: nonsequential: processor requests a transfer to or from an address that is unrelated
*   to the address used in the previous cycle
* - nmreq 0  seq 1: sequential: processor requests a transfer to or from an address that is related to the
*   one in the previous cycle
*
* *********** SIGNALS ************
* mclk: main clock for all memory accesses and processor operations;
* nreset:   when high for 1 clock cycle, the processor starts from address 0x0;
*
* ale:  address latch enable;
*       the address bus, lock, mas, nrw, nopc signals are latched when this is held low
*       (e.g. when interfacing with a ROM, the address must be valid until after the data is read)
* lock: lock any other device from accessing the memory
* mas:  memory access size - 00 = byte, 01 = halfword, 10 = word
* nopc: low if the processor is fetching an instruction from memory
* nwait: used to extend an access over a number of cycles of mclk;
*        should change when mclk is low;
*        used: low, not used: high;
* nrw:  read: low, write: high;
*
* nmreq: not memory request; when the processor requires memory access during the following cycles, this is low
* seq: high on sequential access
*
* din[31:0]:    unidirectional bus for data and instructions from memory to processor;
*               sampled during read cycles on the falling edge of mclk;
* dout[31:0]:   data from processor to memory;
*               during write cycles the output data becomes valid while mclk is low,
*               and remains valid until after the falling edge of mclk;
* sabort:       memory request not allowed
* bl[3:0]:      byte latch control;
*               which bytes to latch from the data bus on the falling edge of the clock
