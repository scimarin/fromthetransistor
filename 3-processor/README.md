Contains 2 CPUs:
- simple 8bit one coded fully in verilog, with no assembler (tiny instruction set); this was made to get the basics right
- ARM7 CPU: CPU in verilog, assembler in Python, linker for assembled files in Python, single data rate, some BRAM, some SRAM
    - [ ] figure out how cheap of an FPGA to get that can handle this
